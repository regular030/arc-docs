# F1TENTH Tutorial T01: Docker and ROS 2

Welcome to your first F1TENTH tutorial! This version includes embedded good coding habits, checklists, documentation links, upcoming visual demos, and now also outlines clear learning objectives, troubleshooting tips, and ROS 2 graph visualization guidance to support you as a beginner. This guide is built for first-year university students and assumes minimal experience with software development. It introduces two powerful tools used in robotics development: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/). You'll learn core concepts, how to apply them, and gain hands-on experience along the way.

> ✅ **Good Habit Reminder**: Always look up official docs before using a command you're unfamiliar with. Bookmark [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/) now!

## Step 1: Go to [Docker Guide](docker.md)

## Step 2: Go to [ROS 2 Guide](ROS2.md)

## 1. Building and Running Inside Docker

### Sample Dockerfile

Dockerfile
FROM ros:humble
RUN apt update && apt install -y python3-colcon-common-extensions
WORKDIR /ros2_ws
COPY . /ros2_ws
RUN . /opt/ros/humble/setup.sh && colcon build
CMD ["bash"]

### ✅ Good Habits Checklist

- [ ] Add a `.dockerignore` file to keep images small  
- [ ] Re-tag and version your Docker builds  
- [ ] Push only working builds to Docker Hub  

🎥 **Coming Soon:** Visual: Docker build + colcon run demo

## 2. Final Assignment

### Objective

- Build a containerized ROS 2 workspace  
- Create a simple publisher node  
- Launch it using Python  
- Push your container to Docker Hub  
- Submit via GitHub Classroom  

> ✅ **Track your changes:** Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` file from the start

## 3. Common Mistakes and Pro Tips

| Mistake                         | Fix                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Not sourcing the setup script   | Run `source install/setup.bash`                |
| Permissions issue on volume     | Add `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` to `docker run` |
| Dependencies missing in package | Add to `package.xml` and `setup.py`            |

✅ Use `tmux` to keep sessions alive  
✅ Use volumes to persist work  
✅ Don’t put ROS source commands in `.bashrc` — see [why here](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Overriding-Environment-Variables.html)

## 4. Resources and What’s Next

### 🔄 Troubleshooting Common ROS 2 Issues

> 🛠️ **Colcon build fails with missing dependencies**  
> Check your `package.xml` and `setup.py` to ensure all dependencies are listed.  
> Use:  
> ```bash
> rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
> ```  
> to auto-install missing ones.

> 🛠️ **Can't find installed packages**  
> Make sure to `source install/setup.bash` after building. Never skip this step.  

> 🛠️ **Docker can't access local folder**  
> Ensure you're using absolute paths with `-v` or `--mount`, and check permissions.

### 🧠 Visualize ROS 2 Graph

Run this command to generate a visual diagram of how your nodes and topics are connected:

```bash
rqt_graph
```

Or use:

```bash
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
```

This produces an image like the one below that shows your full ROS 2 computation graph.
