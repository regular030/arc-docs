## 1. ROS 2: Your Robot's Operating System

🎯 **Learning Objectives**

- Grasp what ROS 2 is and how it enables modular robotics software  
- Understand key components like nodes, topics, and services  
- Know how data flows between different parts of a robotic system  

### What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a framework that helps different parts of a robot — like sensors, motors, and control systems — communicate.  

You can think of a robot as a team of people:

- **Sensors** = the eyes and ears  
- **Motors** = the arms and legs  
- **Control Code** = the brain  

ROS 2 is the language they use to coordinate.
