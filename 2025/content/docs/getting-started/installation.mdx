title: Setup & Installation
description: Install prerequisites, fork the repo, and run the project locally.

## 1. Gather the prerequisites

Install these tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18+ recommended, includes [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Verify installation:

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
git --version
```

<Callout> We use `pnpm` instead of `npm` because it is faster and more efficient. </Callout>

Seeing version numbers means everything is installed correctly.

## 2. Fork the project on GitHub

1. Open the project repository in your browser.
2. Select **Fork** in the top-right corner and choose your personal GitHub account.
3. Wait for GitHub to finish copying the project into your account.

You now have your own copy where you can experiment safely.

## 3. Clone your fork and connect the original project

In your terminal:

```bash
# Replace <your-username> with your GitHub handle
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/arc-docs.git
cd arc-docs
```

Next, point your local copy back to the original repository (often called the *upstream* remote):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ArcInstitute/arc-docs.git
git remote -v
```

The final command should list both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the main project).

## 4. Install dependencies with pnpm

From inside the project folder, install everything the docs site needs:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This downloads packages into a local `node_modules` directory.

If the project stores its docs in a subdirectory (for example, this repository keeps its site in `2025/`), change into that folder and install packages there as well:

```bash
cd 2025
pnpm install
```

<Callout> Some projects prefer `ppnpm` or `yarn`. Always check the repository README or package scripts to confirm which tool to use. </Callout>
