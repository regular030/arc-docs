Contributing to open source can feel intimidating at first.  
Weâ€™ve broken this guide into smaller steps to make it easier:

- [Setup & Installation](./installation)
- [Working with Issues](./issues)
- [Making Your First Contribution](./first-contribution)


<Callout type="warning" title="Start with an issue">
 Before you start coding, always create a **new issue** or pick an **existing one**.  
 This ensures your work is aligned with project needs and avoids duplicate efforts.
