description: How to create or pick an issue before contributing.
---

Before you start coding, always work from an issue. This avoids duplicate work and helps maintainers review faster.

## 1. Create a new issue

- Describe the bug or feature request clearly.  
- Include steps to reproduce or screenshots if relevant.  
- Propose your solution approach if you have one.

## 2. Pick an existing issue

Check for labels like **good first issue** or **help wanted** in the repository.  
Comment on the issue to let others know you are working on it.

Maintainers use issues to track work. Starting without one can result in duplicate or rejected pull requests.
